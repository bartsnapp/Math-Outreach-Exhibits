\begin{context} I need your help\dots


Move all the treasure disks from


``Treasure Island''

\quad \quad to the


\quad \quad \quad \quad ``Pirate Ship''




using the ``Port'' as a
temporary holding area.


Use the ``Port'' wisely!
\end{context}

\begin{directions} To start, set up the three towers, imagining one
tower as the ``Island,'' a middle tower which is the
``Port,'' and a final tower named ``Ship.''  Place 
treasure disks of different sizes on the ``Island'' tower
with the largest at the bottom and the smallest at the top.

Move one treasure disk at a time.  Never place
a larger treasure disk on top of a smaller one.
You can move a treasure chest by picking it up and placing it on top
of another treasure disk or an empty tower.
\end{directions}


\begin{example}
  The initial configuration might look like this:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    % Draw the three towers
    \draw (0,0) -- (0,3) -- (1,3) -- (1,0) -- cycle;
    \draw (3,0) -- (3,3) -- (4,3) -- (4,0) -- cycle;
    \draw (6,0) -- (6,3) -- (7,3) -- (7,0) -- cycle;

    % Draw the disks
    \filldraw[fill=white] (0.5,2.1) circle (0.2);
    \filldraw[fill=white] (0.5,1.4) circle (0.3);
    \filldraw[fill=white] (0.5,0.5) circle (0.4);

    % Draw labels
    \node at (0.5,3.5) {Island};
    \node at (3.5,3.5) {Port};
    \node at (6.5,3.5) {Ship};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{example}
