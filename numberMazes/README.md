# Number Mazes

Mazes involve problem-solving, which is skills in mathematics. By
working through the twists and turns of a maze, individuals can
develop their ability to think critically and analyze different paths
to a solution.

Secondly, solving mazes can also help with spatial reasoning and
visualization, which is important in geometry and other branches of
mathematics. 

Finally, these mazes construct their paths through
arithmetic. Learners will see computations as ``paths'' out of confusion.

Overall, solving mazes helps with developing perseverance, which is an
important skill when learning math. Math can be challenging and
solving mazes can be too, but by working through the challenges of a
maze, individuals can build up their persistence and determination to
keep trying when faced with difficult problems.
