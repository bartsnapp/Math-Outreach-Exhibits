    Batten down the hatches, time to sink some ships!

  
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
\begin{itemize}
\item First, you secretly put your ships on the grid.
\item Then, you take turns guessing where your friend's ships are. If
  you guess right, your friend marks the ``hit'' and you get to guess
  again.  If you guess wrong, it's your friend's turn.
\item The game goes on until one of you sinks all of the other person's
ships.
\end{itemize}
