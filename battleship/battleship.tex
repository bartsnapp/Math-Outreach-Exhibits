\textit{Battleship} is a fun game you play with a friend. You each have a bunch of ships and you try to sink your friend's ships by guessing where they are on a grid.

First, you secretly put your ships on the grid. Then, you take turns guessing where your friend's ships are. If you guess right, you get to guess again. If you guess wrong, it's your friend's turn.

The game goes on until one of you sinks all of the other person's ships. Try to be the first one to sink all the ships to win the game!
