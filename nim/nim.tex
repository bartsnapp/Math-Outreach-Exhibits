\begin{context} Today I will be engaging in a combinatorial game with
a worthy opponent. My opponent and I will be playing with numbers and
strategies, trying to outsmart each other with our mathematical
prowess.

As I set sail on this new adventure, I am confident in my abilities
and the strategies I have devised. I have studied the game thoroughly
and am prepared for any challenge that may come my way.

\begin{directions}
  Nim is a game in which 2 players take turns removing objects from piles.

  On your turn, you
  \begin{itemize}
    \item must remove at least one object, and
    \item may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same pile.
  \end{itemize}
  You win if you take the last object.
