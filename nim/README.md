# Nim

Combinatorial games like Nim are valuable for students to learn
because they provide an opportunity to practice and develop
mathematical skills such as problem-solving, logical thinking, and
strategic planning. These games often involve the manipulation of
numbers and the application of mathematical concepts such as
combinatorics.

By playing these games, students can develop their understanding of
mathematical principles in a fun and engaging way. They learn how to
analyze different scenarios and make logical conclusions based on the
information presented to them. Additionally, these games can help
students learn about different strategies for solving problems, such
as the greedy algorithm, which can be applied to other areas of
mathematics and computer science.

Combinatorial games have a strong connection to game theory which is
the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between
intelligent rational decision-makers. Game theory is used in many
fields, including economics, political science, and
psychology.
