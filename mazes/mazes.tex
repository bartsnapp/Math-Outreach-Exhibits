Land ahoy!

A treasure most fine is said to be hidden


on this mysterious island, 


by mazes of convoluted design.



Unlike any seen before,


with twists and turns that defy the laws of land and sea alike.



Help me solve me maze, and learn to think in new directions!

\begin{directions}

    \item Choose a paper maze
\item Use scissors to cut along the marked lines 
\item Apply tape if needed
  \item Use a pencil to solve the maze
\end{itemize}
