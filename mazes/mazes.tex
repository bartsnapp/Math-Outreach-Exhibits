\title{Pirate Map Mazes}

\input{../pirate.sty}

\begin{document}

\begin{context} We have discovered a treasure map leading to a
mysterious island, where the treasure is said to be hidden in mazes on
strange surfaces. These mazes are unlike any I have ever seen before,
with twists and turns that defy the laws of traditional geometry.

I could see that the mazes were indeed located on M\"obius bands, a surface with only one side and one edge. I knew that solving these mazes would require a deep understanding of the properties of this unusual surface, as well as a willingness to think outside the box.
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Choose a paper maze
\item Use scissors to cut along the marked lines 
\item Apply tape if needed
  \item Use a pencil to solve the maze
\end{itemize}
\end{directions}
