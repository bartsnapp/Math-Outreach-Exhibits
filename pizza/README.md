# Pizza and Fractions

Here we explore fractions without explicitly talking about
fractions. We use rectangular pizzas because they are easier to break
into pieces whose sizes are more representative of equal.


We start with a number, and we tell the student how many out of the
number prefer different options.


To make the problem harder, simply make the number bigger, or express
the preferences in lowest terms. For example, if there are 12 total, we
could say 3 out of 4 prefer a given choice. In this context it would
mean that 9 out of 12 prefer the choice.
