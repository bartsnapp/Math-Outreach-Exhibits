# Pi-rate walk



When we first learn about numbers, we learn about *whole* numbers. These are numbers 1,2,3,4,5,...

π is not a whole number. 

Later we learn about *rational* numbers. These are numbers that are all whole numbers, there negatives, and fractions of those. Numbers like 22/7 and -3/4 are rational numbers. 

π is not a rational number. 


We have to get used to the fact that there are different types of numbers, π is what's called a *transcendental* number. This means when written as a decimal, π's digits neither terminate nor repeat.
