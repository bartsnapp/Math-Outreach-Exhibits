  DISCOVERY is a state of life for ME,
   as a TRUE $\pi$-rate be.\\

   How few colors, and the tilings of ONE STONE are amoung our newest
   treasures!
  
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
  Make this BEAUTIFUL by coloring it in with as few colors as possible
  and no adjacent tiles having the same color.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item These tilings of one shape with NO PATTERN were discovered in 2023.
  \item The four color theorem says you need 4 or fewer colors. This
    was proved in 1976.
  \end{itemize}
