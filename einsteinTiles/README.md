# Einstein Tiling and the Four Color Theorem


Most of the mathematics one learns in school is very old. Here we
present some new findings that are really accessible all.


The einstein tiling (so-called because "einstein" means "one stone") is a tiling with no "repeated pattern" that is made from 1 tile. Before 2023, humans didn't even know if something liked this existed. 


On the other hand, the four color theorem says that pictures like
these require only four colors to fill in, assuming we must have
different colors for different regions.
