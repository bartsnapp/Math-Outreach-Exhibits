Here we give a coloring-book computer. This was developed here:

In essence "nory" is a NOR gate, meaning a neither-nor gate.  You can
think of a NOR gate as a gate that only produces a true output (a
rectangle) when both of its inputs are false (circles). If either
input is true (is rectangle), the output is false (a circle).


The cool thing about NOR gates is that you can use them to make all
the other gates in a computer, like AND gates and OR gates. It's like
having one super useful tool that can do many jobs! So, you can think
of NOR gates as the building blocks that make computers work.
