\begin{context}
  Today was a troublesome day! I decided to make a stop at a port town to stock up on supplies. We visited a local store, but when he handed over a gold doubloon, I struggled to make change.  I fumbled with my coin pouch and counted out the coins multiple times.
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
  You can use your pirate money here to buy various fun items.

  The items have unusual prices, so like the Captain, be careful when
making change!
