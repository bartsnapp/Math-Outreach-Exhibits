# Counting Coins

This activity is about recognizing multiples of numbers to assist in
counting.

While it can start off quite simple, it actually demonstrates an
important principle in number theory and algebra: By looking at the
remainder of a number with various quotients, we can identify the
number itself. This is sometimes called the Sunzi Theorem.
