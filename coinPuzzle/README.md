# Coin puzzles

These "coin" puzzles can be played anywhere and don't even require
coins. By working on smaller puzzles, learners develop their own
algorithm for solving them.

This is a great example of how a difficult problem (like the 6 coin
puzzle) can be understood by trying a simpler version (the 2 coin and
4 coin variants).
