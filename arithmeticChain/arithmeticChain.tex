\title{Pirate Chains}

\begin{document}

\begin{context}
  As the sun set on the horizon, I felt a sense of satisfaction wash over me. I may be a math pirate and I enjoy a good bit of arithmetic. I'll be back at it again tomorrow, buildin' me chain of problems ever longer.
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
Take one of the problems written on small pieces of paper.

When you finish a problem, you will add it to a chain of papers by using a stapler.

We will try to make the chain as long as we can!

Each piece of paper will be connected to the next one.
