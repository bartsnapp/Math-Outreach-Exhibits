# Welcome Table

A math outreach night is a valuable event that aims to bring the
excitement and curiosity of mathematics to a wider audience. This
event is designed to make math more accessible and engaging, by
providing hands-on activities, puzzles and games. It is an opportunity
for people of all ages and backgrounds to learn about math in a fun
and interactive way.

By using a pirate theme, the math outreach night aims to make the math
experience more engaging and relatable, as well as making it more
accessible to non-math enthusiasts. Pirates are seen as adventurous,
curious and exciting, and by using this theme, the event is able to
bring those same qualities to math. 

The outreach night is a great opportunity for participants to learn
math in a new and exciting way, and to discover that math is not just
about numbers and equations, but also about creativity,
problem-solving, and exploration.
