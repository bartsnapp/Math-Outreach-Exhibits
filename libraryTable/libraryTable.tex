\begin{context} We've been sailing the seven seas for quite some time
now and I think it's about time we set up a library for all the crew
members. The ship's library will be a place for the crew to relax and
engage in some creative crafts.
\end{context}

\begin{directions} Take part in these fun craft projects!
