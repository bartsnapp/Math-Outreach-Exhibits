# Tangrams


Tangrams are a puzzle where you try to place a square, two large
isosceles right triangles, a parallelogram, a medium isosceles right
triangle, and two small isosceles right triangles into various shapes.

Solving a tangram puzzle amounts to seeing structure where there seems
to be initially none. This idea of seeing structure where initially
there is none, is a the heart of discovery in mathematics.
