\section*{An alligator, a parrot, and biscuits.}

A pirate captain has an alligator, a parrot, and biscuits. He wants to
cross a river, but his boat will hold only one item beside himself. He
cannot leave the alligator with the parrot, or the parrot with the
biscuits.

How can the pirate captain get all three across the river?

\section*{Pirates and sailors.}

The pirates and sailors problem involves three pirates and three
sailors trying to cross a river. They have a boat that can hold at
most two people at a time. However, the sailors must never be
outnumbered by pirates on either side of the river, or the pirates
will attack the sailors.

How can all six people cross the river?
