\begin{context}
Today we came across a tricky situation: we needed to cross a river but we had many logical constraints!  I am thankful for the mathematical skills of my crew.
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
  You're a pirate captain with an alligator, a parrot, and biscuits.

  You wants to cross a river, but your boat will hold only one item beside yourself.

  You cannot leave the alligator with the parrot, or the parrot with the biscuits.

  How can you get all \textbf{three} across the river?
