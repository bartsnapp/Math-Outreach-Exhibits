\begin{context}
Ye may know how t' count yer treasure, but do ye know the secret of place value?
Let me explain, when ye have a number like ``12'' it's made up of two digits, ``1'' and ``2''. The ``1'' represents the number of tens, and the ``2'' represents the number of ones. So ``12'' means one ten and two ones, or 12.
\end{context}

\begin{directions}
You will get a surprise number and throw beanbags into treasure chests.

Some chests are worth more.  One beanbag in the ``tens'' chest is worth ten.  A beanbag in the ``hundreds'' chest is worth one hundred!  Can you build your surprise number by throwing beanbags into the chests?
