Ye may know how t' count yer treasure, but do ye know the secret of
place value?



\end{context}

\begin{directions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Golds coins are worth 100,
\item Silvers coins are worth 10, and
\item Bronze coins are worth 1.
Help the pirates use as few coins as possible to express the value of
their treasure!
\end{itemize}
\end{directions}

\begin{example}
  
  A $\pi$-rate has 2 gold, 3 silver and 9 bronze.

  They find 7 more silver and 2 more bronze.

  With the fewest coins possible, express their treasure!
