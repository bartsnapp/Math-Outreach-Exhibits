# Cyphers

Mathematics plays a fundamental role in cryptography by providing the
tools and concepts needed to secure information and create codes or
ciphers. 


In our case, adding values of a deck of cards is a simple form of
cryptography using mathematics. More complex cryptographic techniques
rely on mathematical principles like prime numbers, modular
arithmetic, and algorithms to encrypt and decrypt messages. This
math-based security ensures that only authorized individuals can
access and understand sensitive information, helping to keep data safe
and secure.
